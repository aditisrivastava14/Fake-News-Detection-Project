# 📰 Fake News Detection Project

This project aims to detect **fake news articles** using Machine Learning techniques. It explores text preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification models to distinguish between *real* and *fake* news.

## 🚀 Features

* Data preprocessing: text cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal.
* Feature extraction: TF-IDF / CountVectorizer.
* ML Models: Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, etc.
* Evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used for training/testing consists of labeled news articles (Real/Fake).
*(Add dataset link here – e.g., Kaggle: [Fake News Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/fake-news))*

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aditisrivastava14/Fake-News-Detection-Project.git
cd Fake-News-Detection-Project
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook

```bash
Jupyter Notebook "Fake News Detection Project.ipynb"
```

## 📈 Results

* Achieved **X% accuracy** with Logistic Regression.
* Compared multiple ML models for performance.
* Best model: **[mention best performing model here]**

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Explore deep learning models (LSTMs, Transformers).
* Deploy as a web application with Flask/Streamlit.
* Enhance dataset diversity for robustness.
